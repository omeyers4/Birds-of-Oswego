        <h2>Nesting</h2>

        <p>
            Egg-laying begins during February and March in the warmer southern states and March and April in the northern and colder states. Bluebirds typically lay 4 to 5 eggs, though in some cases, they can have clutch sizes of up to 7 eggs. The color of the Bluebird egg is normally blue. But rarely some females lay white eggs or pink eggs.

        <h2>Habitat</h2> 
        <p>
            Eastern Bluebirds live in meadows and openings surrounded by trees that offer suitable nest holes. With the increase in nest boxes and bluebird trails, bluebirds are now a common sight along roads, field edges, golf courses, and other open areas. During the winter Bluebirds migrate to southeastern U.S. or Mexico. Some fly as far as 2,000 miles between western Manitoba and Texas.
